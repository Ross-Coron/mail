# Mail 

Front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send, receive, and archive / unarchive emails.

Single-page application written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Designed and implemented by [Ross P. Coron](https://ross-coron.github.io/website/) as part of CS50W's [Mail PSET](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/).

Video walkthrough and write up of application forthcoming. In the interim, please find links to my previous [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmM-xsBekDY&list=PLceSURr52luABPsaXewux7tXeiB3Tl6wG&ab_channel=RossP.Coron) and [written](https://medium.com/@rpcoron) content on previous PSETs.
